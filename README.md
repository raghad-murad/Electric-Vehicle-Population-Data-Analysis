## üåü Overview

The objective of this assignment is to analyze the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** dataset to gain insights into electric vehicle registrations across Washington State. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**:
   - Document missing values and apply strategies such as mean imputation, median imputation, and row removal.
   - Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Normalize numerical features using Min-Max scaling and standardization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical features.
   - Visualize spatial distributions of EVs by city and county.
   - Analyze the popularity of different EV models and types.
   - Investigate relationships between numeric features using correlation matrices.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Generate various plots to explore feature relationships, including correlation heatmaps, boxplots, scatter plots, histograms, count plots, and pair plots.
   - Create comparative visualizations across locations (cities and counties) to highlight EV distribution.

4. **Additional Analysis**:
   - Conduct temporal analysis to examine trends in EV adoption over time.

The implementation is divided into modular parts, each focusing on a specific task:

1. **Part 1: Document Missing Values**
   - Identifies and summarizes missing values in the dataset.
   - Visualizes the distribution of missing values across features.

2. **Part 2: Missing Value Strategies**
   - Applies strategies like mean imputation, median imputation, and row removal.
   - Compares the impact of these strategies on the dataset.

3. **Part 3: Feature Encoding**
   - Encodes categorical features using one-hot encoding.

4. **Part 4: Normalization**
   - Normalizes numerical features using Min-Max scaling and standardization.

5. **Part 5: Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculates summary statistics for numerical features.

6. **Part 6: Spatial Distribution**
   - Visualizes the spatial distribution of EVs by city and county.
   - Performs geospatial analysis to plot EV distribution across regions.

7. **Part 7: Model Popularity**
   - Analyzes the popularity of different EV models and types.
   - Tracks trends in model popularity over time.

8. **Part 8: Investigate Relationships**
   - Computes and visualizes correlations between numeric features.

9. **Part 9: Data Exploration Visualizations**
   - Generates various plots to explore feature relationships.

10. **Part 10: Comparative Visualization**
    - Creates bar charts and stacked bar charts to compare EV distributions across cities and counties.

11. **Part 11: Temporal Analysis**
    - Examines trends in EV adoption over time.
    - Visualizes the popularity of EV models and types over the years.
